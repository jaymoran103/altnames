# POSSIBLE FUTURE FEATURES

[ ] Adapt name bank from poc demo for version without faker dependency.  

[ ] Save more config fields in mapping files. Column names?

[ ] Consider enforcing save file format, adding .json tag or to files with no extension and rejecting files with other extensions.

[ ] Add support for -c "First Last" name format, in place of -c First\ Last, which is fine but less accessible. Not a priority for current use.

[ ] Add direct renaming and a dryrun feature? Not needed for my use case.

[ ] Add option to tokenize over other common name components? Not needed for my use case.
